# OmniAgent Enhanced Architecture Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the OmniAgent architecture to transform it from a basic agent framework into a sophisticated, enterprise-grade platform with advanced capabilities for complex task execution and multi-agent coordination. The enhanced architecture follows a 4-layer approach that builds upon the current implementation while incorporating key concepts from both the ideal architecture and Claude Code reference.

4.4. The system SHALL support integration with Database/Storage systems.
4.5. The system SHALL provide standardized interfaces for all external integrations.

### 5. Event-Driven Coordination System
As a system administrator, I want an event-driven coordination system so that all components can communicate efficiently and in real-time.

5.1. The system SHALL implement a System-Reminder mechanism as the coordination nervous system.
5.2. The system SHALL provide a central event dispatcher for all component communication.
5.3. The system SHALL include a message factory for standardized inter-component communication.
5.4. The system SHALL implement a context injector for intelligent event processing.
5.5. The system SHALL provide real-time status updates with spinner/V0 status message system.

### 6. UI Integration (Future Phase)
As a user, I want a rich user interface so that I can interact with the system more intuitively.

6.1. The system SHALL support React-based UI components for enhanced user experience (future phase).
6.2. The system SHALL provide real-time state synchronization between agent and UI.
